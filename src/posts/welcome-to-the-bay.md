Hi! We’re Sabrena and Adrianna, a married couple living in San Francisco. We’ve each lived all over the globe. For now, this city has been the perfect spot for our little family.

We started this site to keep a record of some of the fun (and not so fun things) that we get up to here, and elsewhere. Many of our friends and family live abroad, but we’re on a social media fast (mostly off Facebook), so this will have to do.

Some folks want to see photos. Others want to see our pets. Sometimes, we have good recipes to share too.

We will be adding more content to this site shortly. Stay tuned!
